# MaxOneOpen â€“ No-Code Rule Execution Demo

This repository provides a functional demo of **no-code rule execution**, based on the declarative capsule logic used in **MaxOneOpen v4.1**.

> ðŸ§­ MaxOneOpen is a publicly disclosed, verifiable meta-infrastructure that enables structural control over digital processes â€“ without writing or executing any code.

## ðŸ§ª What This Demo Shows

- Rule-based logic without backend code  
- Structural enforcement of roles and conditions  
- Declarative capsules replacing traditional programming  
- Fully local execution â€“ no dependencies or cloud required

## ðŸ“„ Capsule Logic (Declarative, Not Coded)

```json
{
  "id": "SubmitForm",
  "role": "Admin",
  "rules": [
    { "type": "signature", "requiredKey": "ControllerKey" },
    { "type": "field", "name": "status", "equals": "ready" }
  ],
  "reaction": ["store", "notify"]
}
```

The behavior above is **not programmed**.  
It is structurally defined and enforced through the MaxOneOpen capsule engine.
